Section to save training model (create train and test mode) then add user data to train data to improve the model 
Provides feedback to user based on how to improve their sleep score(i.e. which features were most effected by changes in sleep score)

User gives actual sleep acuracy back each day and show the error rate between the prediction and actual accuracy
